    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I'm a film photographer with a passion for capturing moments on analog film. When I'm not in the darkroom, you'll find me working on arcade games, playing trombone and keyboard, or making games. I work as a software developer at Red Hat and love exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.</p>
    
    <p>I have a deep appreciation for movies and the art of storytelling through visual media. My photography is influenced by this cinematic perspective, always looking for those decisive moments that tell a story.</p>
